See instruction to launch Companion on GitHub Codespaces in the Use on Mobile via GitHub Codespaces section.</p> <p>Companion uses OpenAI ChatGPT &amp; Whisper and  Google Text-to-Speech &amp;  Translate to create your own personal private tutor for learning a new foreign language. You can write, talk, read and listen  in both your native language and selected foreign language. It's also configured to correct any mistakes you make.</p> <p>Companion is distributed free of charge for any non-commercial usage. Note that the different APIs and services used are not necessarily free, and might charge you based on your usage. </p>"},{"location":"blogposts/","title":"Related Blogposts","text":"<ul> <li>How I Coded My Own Private French Tutor Out of ChatGPT</li> <li>7 Lessons Learned on Creating a Complete Product Using ChatGPT</li> </ul>"},{"location":"codespace/","title":"Use on Mobile via GitHub Codespaces","text":"<p>In order to use Companion on your mobile device, you can use GitHub Codespaces as your server.
